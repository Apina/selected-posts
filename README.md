#Selected Posts

##A WordPress Plugin

Selected Posts allows you to show specific posts in a sidebar.

You can choose to show the title, a featured image, and an excerpt (you can set the length of this in words).

You can add more than one post by using a comma spearated list of post ID's.

It also supports Custom Post Types.
